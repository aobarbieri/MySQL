CAST(int AS CHAR)
-- CAST is used to convert a value from one data type to another
-- List of CAST specifications:
-- SIGNED: Converts a value to a signed integer, which can include both positive and negative numbers.
-- UNSIGNED: Converts a value to an unsigned integer, which can only include non-negative numbers.
-- CHAR or CHARACTER: Converts a value to a character string.
-- VARCHAR: Converts a value to a variable-length character string.
-- BINARY: Converts a value to a binary string.
-- VARBINARY: Converts a value to a variable-length binary string.
-- TEXT: Converts a value to a text string.
-- BLOB: Converts a value to a binary large object (BLOB).
-- DATE: Converts a value to a date type, which includes only the date (year, month, and day).
-- TIME: Converts a value to a time type, which includes only the time (hours, minutes, and seconds).
-- DATETIME: Converts a value to a datetime type, which includes both the date and time.
-- TIMESTAMP: Converts a value to a timestamp type, similar to DATETIME, often used for tracking record changes.
-- YEAR: Converts a value to a year type.
-- DECIMAL or NUMERIC: Converts a value to a fixed-point decimal, useful for precise financial calculations. Precision (total number of digits) and scale (number of digits after the decimal point) can be specified.
-- FLOAT: Converts a value to a floating-point number, which can represent a wide range of values with fractional components.
-- DOUBLE: Converts a value to a double-precision floating-point number, which offers more precision than FLOAT.
-- REAL: Converts a value to a floating-point number, typically treated the same as FLOAT or DOUBLE depending on the database.
-- BOOLEAN: Converts a value to a boolean type, representing TRUE or FALSE.
-- JSON: Converts a value to a JSON type, which stores data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, useful for semi-structured data.
